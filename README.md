# Goals
## General
* implement cassandra v3 protocol leveraging the tokio ecosystem to the fullest.
* safety first - the client will verify all input received from the server.
* test-first development - no code exists unless a test needs it to pass.
* high-performance - stream as much as possible and reduce amount of allocations to a minimum.
* leave it flexible enough to easily provide support for protocol version 4 and later 5.
* develop breadth first - thus we are implementing orthogonal features first to learn how that affects the API and architecture, before implementing every single data-type or message-type.
* strive for an MVP and version 1.0 fast, even if that includes only the most common usecases.
* Prefer to increment major version rapidly instead of keeping major version zero for longer than needed.

## Minimal Viable Product and v1.0
* library supports basic queries without UDTs and can provide the result via an unauthenticated and unencrypted connection.
* a CLI allows to perform such a query, and output results in JSON format.
